  MERN STACK 

The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that’s designed to make the development process smoother. MERN includes four open-source components: 
->MongoDB
->Express
->React
->Node.js
These components provide an end-to-end framework for developers to work in. 

1)  MongoDB: A cross-platform document database
 
MongoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational) document-oriented database.
MongoDB is schema-less. Data is stored in flexible documents with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-based query language. The content, size, and number of fields in the documents can differ from one to the next. This means that the data structure to be changed over time.It is known for being flexible and easy to scale.

2)  Express: A back-end web application framework

Express is a web application framework for Node.js, another MERN component. Instead of writing full web server code by hand on Node.js directly, developers use Express to simplify the task of writing server code.
The Express framework is designed for building robust web applications and APIs. It’s known for its fast speed and minimalist structure, with many features available as plugins.

3)   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

The React library can be used for creating views rendered in HTML. React views are declarative. This means that developers don’t have to worry about managing the effects of changes in the view’s state (the object that determines how components behave) or changes in the data.
Instead of relying on templates to automate the creation of repetitive HTML or DOM (Document Object Model) elements, React uses a full-featured programming language (JavaScript) to construct repetitive or conditional DOM elements.
With React, the same code can run on both the server and the browser.

4)   Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment

Node.js is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It’s designed to build scalable network applications, and can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.
Node.js works without an enclosing HTML page, instead using its own module system based on CommonJS, to put together multiple JavaScript files.
